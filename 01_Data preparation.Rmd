## Overview

The city of Leipzig conducted Youth Surveys in the years 2010, 2015 and 2023. 
Here, we are going to start by loading the data and taking an initial look at it.

## Let's get started with the 2010 Youth Survey
In 2010, the city of Leipzig actually conducted two parallel Youth Surveys. 
All the following information was taken from the official report: "Jugend in Leipzig -- Ergebnisse einer Befragung 2010 [07/2011]" issued by Stadt Leipzig, Amt für Statistik und Wahlen in Kooperation mit dem Amt für Jugend, Familie und Bildung.

### Sampling procedure
First, students between the ages of 12 and 17 were targeted within their respective schools (although students within the same classes who happened to be older were surveyed as well). 
Second, young people between the ages of 18 and 27 were contacted separately based on registry information, to ensure that young people who already left school were represented as well.
Only the first survey has a methodology comparable to the 2015 and 2023 Youth Surveys, so we will exclusively rely on that data and ignore the survey involving older young people.

For the Youth Survey that took part in schools, initially schools were selected, in within those schools whole classes were assessed.
The targeted inital sample size was 3000, which was distributed according to the actual distribution of students between the ages of 12 to 17 in the four types of schools included and the grade levels included (Mittelschule: grades 7 to 10, Gymnasium: grades 7 to 12, Berufs-/Fachoberschule: first and second year, Förderschule: grades 7 to 10).
The corresponding schools and classrooms were then picked, prioritising schools who had participated in earlier Youth Surveys for organisational reasons.
In total, there were 3459 students in the targeted classes.
Of these, a total of 2411 (70%) participated in the Youth Survey and can be found in our data set.
The data were collected between October 18th and November 5th 2010.

To my knowledge, no weights were generated for the official report issued by the city.

## 2015 Youth Survey
The next Youth Survey was conducted five years later. 
The following information was taken from the official report: "Jugend in Leipzig – Ergebnisse einer Befragung 2015 [08/2015]" issued by Stadt Leipzig, Amt für Statistik und Wahlen in Kooperation mit dem
Amt für Jugend, Familie und Bildung.

### Sampling procedure
In 2015, only one survey took place, targeting students within their respective schools.

Again, schools were initially selected, and within those schools whole classes were assessed for reasons of efficiency. 
The targeted initial sample size was again 3000, which was again distributed according to the actual distribution of students across the included types of schools and grade levels (Oberschule, formerly called Mittelschule: grades 7 to 10, Gymnasium: grades 7 to *11*, Berufs-/Fachoberschule: first, second *and third* year, Förderschule: grades 7 to 10). 
In total, 3298 students were in the targeted classes.
Of these, a total of 2255 (75%) participated in the Youth Survey and can be found in our data set.
The data were collected between May 7th and June 1st 2015, which is why the students in grade 12 at Gymnasium are missing -- they already finished their final examinations (Abitur).

To my knowledge, no weights were generated for the official report issued by the city.

## 2023 Youth Survey
The next Youth Survey was supposed to happen in 2020 but was delayed by 3 years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The following information was taken from the official report: "Jugend in Leipzig 2023" issued by Stadt Leipzig, Amt für Statistik und Wahlen/Amt für Jugend un Familie/Amt für Schule.

### Sampling procedure
In 2023, the sampling procedures were adjusted.
Instead of first selecting schools and then assessing the relevant classrooms within those schools, classrooms were drawn across schools.
This change was implemented to increase the variability in the data and improve the representativeness of the results.
Furthermore, students from special-needs schools were intentionally oversampled, and weights were generated to account for this overrepresentation.

A total of 212 classrooms across 68 schools were initially selected for the cluster sample, covering a total of 5000 students, which was anticipated to result in a sample size of 3000 students given previous experiences with response rates.
When school headmaster refused to participate (which happened for a total of 9 schools), reserve schools were contacted.
According to the official report, for pragmatic reasons there were some deviations from the initially intended sample.
A total of 3053 questionnaires was filled out of which 3 had to be removed due to nonresponse of obviously fake answers.

The data were collected between March 1st and April 28th 2023, which means that students in grade 12 at Gymnasium could be included.
Approximately 65% of students filled out the questionnaire on a tablet as opposed to on paper.
